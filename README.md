## Titles System

Certain achievements unlock a compact **title** (e.g. *"Explorer"*, *"Onybane"*, *"Marshal"*).

- Open the UI (`/rlcach`) and navigate to the **Titles** tab to see all unlocked titles.
- Select a title to make it active â€” it will appear in orange (or red for Legendary, brown for Guild) before your text when you speak in guild chat.
- Legendary and Guild titles have distinct colour formatting.

---

## Guild Chat Integration

When a title is active the addon hooks `SendChatMessage` to prepend your title to **guild** messages only. Example output:

```
[Explorer] Methl: Has anyone done RFC today?
```

The hook is installed 3 seconds after `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` to avoid interfering with addon loading. It only modifies `GUILD` channel messages and ignores slash commands and system messages.

---

## SavedVariables

All data is persisted in `RLC_AchievementsDB` (kept in the `.toc` file for compatibility):

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `achievements` | Table of earned achievements per player character. |
| `exploredZones` | Table of discovered zones/subzones per player character. |
| `selectedTitles` | Currently active title per player character. |
| `dungeonProgress` | Per-dungeon boss kill tracking. |
| `raidProgress` | Per-raid boss kill tracking. |
| `progressCounters` | Generic numeric counters (kills, emotes, etc.). |
| `completedQuests` | Completed quest chain steps per player character. |
| `peakGold` | Highest gold amount ever held per player character. |
| `minimapAngle` | Saved minimap button angle (in degrees, 0â€“360). |

---

   ```lua
   ACHIEVEMENTS["my_ach"] = {
     id       = "my_ach",

     category = "Casual",   -- must match an existing category
     points   = 10,
     icon     = "Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_QuestionMark",
   }
   ```
3. Award it in the appropriate event handler:
   ```lua
   RedLobsterCultAchievements:AwardAchievement("my_ach")
   ```

### Adding a new data file

1. Create `data/RLC_Ach_MyCategory.lua`.
2. Register achievements with `RedLobsterCultAchievements:AddAchievement(...)` inside an `ADDON_LOADED` event guard.
3. Add the file path to `RedLobsterCultAchievements.toc` after `RedLobsterCultAchievements.lua`.

```
/achtestdebug
```
